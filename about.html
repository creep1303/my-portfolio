      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>âœ¨ Who Am I?</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Mithila Rahman Ridita, Gaming is not just a time pass for me, it's one of my comfort zone.
         The comfort I feel while playing games, I think I would never find it in something else. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>ðŸ’» What I Do</h3>
      <p>
        I'm stll a student, still learning, growing and expending through life. Besides my classes and courses I try to explore more about streaming.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3> ðŸŽ€Me Core</h3>
      <p>
          Think soft lights, cozy aesthetics, honest conversations, and a dash of glitter. I love pastel tones, chill moods, and content that feels
           like a deep breath. Whether Iâ€™m gaming, chatting, or creating, I want people to feel like they can exhale with me.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>ðŸš€ My Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Streaming isnâ€™t just something I want to try â€” itâ€™s something I feel. The energy of going live, the real-time connection, 
        the freedom to just be *me* â€” thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m headed. I want to build a space that feels like a safe room full of friends, laughter, and glow and lots of chaos.
      </p>
